# Taihei Mihon

Mihon (見本) means sample or specimen. Taihei Mihon is a **fake-data generator for Scala 3 in many
languages**: text, people, addresses, phone numbers, dates, files, ids and sample images, in the
script and conventions of the language you choose, from a seed when you want the same values on
every run. Cross-compiled for the **JVM and Scala.js**.

Part of the [Taihei Framework](https://taihei.dev), the open-source Scala 3
libraries from Innovenso. The package is `dev.taihei.mihon`. Up to 4.x the library was called
taihei-lorem: see [Coming from taihei-lorem 4.x](#coming-from-taihei-lorem-4x).

## Modules

Published on Maven Central under `dev.taihei`:

| Artifact            | Platform | Notes                                                  |
| ------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `taihei-mihon`      | JVM      | Language data read from the classpath.                 |
| `taihei-mihon_sjs1` | Scala.js | Language data compiled in; runs in the browser or Node. |

```scala
mvn"dev.taihei::taihei-mihon:5.0.0"       // Mill, JVM
mvn"dev.taihei::taihei-mihon::5.0.0"      // Mill, Scala.js
"dev.taihei" %% "taihei-mihon" % "5.0.0"  // sbt, JVM
"dev.taihei" %%% "taihei-mihon" % "5.0.0" // sbt, Scala.js (sbt-scalajs or sbt-crossproject)
```

`shared/` holds the generator and, in `shared/resources/`, the language data; `jvm/` and `js/`
carry only the platform-specific loader of that data. Depends on
[Taihei Tsuji](https://github.com/taiheiframework/tsuji) for `Language`.

Mihon is for tests, seed data and mock-ups. Its language data adds a few megabytes to a Scala.js
bundle, so it does not belong in a production browser bundle.

5.0.0 is the first release under the name Taihei Mihon, and a major release: see
[Coming from taihei-lorem 4.x](#coming-from-taihei-lorem-4x). The 4.x line keeps its name,
`dev.taihei::taihei-lorem`, and receives security fixes for 12 months after the release of
Taihei Mihon 5.0.0.

## Stack

- Mill 1.3.1
- Scala 3.9.0 (LTS) · Scala.js 1.22.0
- ZIO 2.1.27 (`zio-json` 1.1, `zio-test`)
- `dev.taihei::taihei-tsuji` 5.0.0 · scala-java-time 2.8 and scalajs-java-securerandom (JS)

Everything resolves from Maven Central; the build needs no credentials.

## Build

```sh
make compile        # ./mill __.compile           (JVM + JS)
make test           # ./mill __.test.testForked    (JVM + JS; JS runs on Node)
make fmt            # ./mill __.reformat
make fix            # ./mill __.fix                 (scalafix)
make validate       # repo-guard + fix + fmt + compile + test + mima + budget
make budget         # the size budget of the data, the JVM jar and the Scala.js output
make mima           # binary compatibility with the newest release tag
make publishLocal   # to ~/.ivy2/local (a SNAPSHOT only)
```

## Releasing

The version is the git tag: an exact `v`-tag on a clean tree is the release,
anything else a SNAPSHOT of the last tag.

```sh
make release-prepare TYPE=patch|minor|major EMBARGO=0|1
                                               # validate, write RELEASE_x_y_z.md
make release-finalize                          # commit the notes, tag locally, check
                                               # both registries, build and sign the
                                               # bundle once, upload it to GitHub
                                               # Packages and read every file back
git push origin main && git push origin vX.Y.Z # only after the read-back succeeded
make release-github                            # the bundle on an immutable GitHub Release
make publish-dry-run                           # the signed bundle, written to out/
```

A release is built and signed once. Its files go unchanged to this repository's
GitHub Packages registry first, and to Maven Central with the next release train,
so a new version can take up to a month to reach Central; `SHA256SUMS` on the
GitHub Release lists the SHA-256 of every file, and both registries serve
exactly those bytes. A security fix goes to Central first (`EMBARGO=1`). The
build itself resolves from Maven Central only, and `make validate` checks it
(`repo-guard`). A release publishes only the commit `release-prepare`
validated, and refuses when a file git does not track is in a source or
resource folder, or a stray build file is in the tree.

`make publish` is only for a security fix under embargo, which goes to Central
first; it refuses any other version. It reads the Central Portal user token and
the release key from `~/.edo-release.env` (a name from the Edo Framework days, kept because the
maintainers' workstations write it for every library; `RELEASE_ENV=…`
points elsewhere) or the environment (`MILL_SONATYPE_USERNAME`,
`MILL_SONATYPE_PASSWORD`, `MILL_PGP_SECRET_BASE64`, `MILL_PGP_PASSPHRASE`).
The upload to GitHub Packages reads a `write:packages` token from
`~/.taihei-packages-publish.env` alone, and the read-back a `read:packages`
token from Coursier's credentials file (host `maven.pkg.github.com`); neither
is ever in `~/.edo-release.env`.
Releases are signed by the Taihei Framework release key,
fingerprint `5026 B299 6DDB 697E C463  0BCF 14A7 33E2 A507 702F`.

## Quick start

```scala
import dev.taihei.mihon.Mihon
import dev.taihei.tsuji.Language

val mihon = Mihon.secure()      // English, values that do not repeat

mihon.name                      // "Linda Robinson"
mihon.email                     // "linda.robinson@brightwavehub.example"
mihon.paragraph                 // a paragraph of English words
mihon.address.singleLine        // "180 Cedar Lane, Houston, Texas 77233, United States"
mihon.phone                     // "+1 537 555-0154", a number reserved for fiction
mihon.localDate                 // a random java.time.LocalDate
mihon.id                        // a UUID-shaped identifier

val lorem = Mihon.seeded(42L, Language("la"))
lorem.paragraph                 // Lorem Ipsum
```

A generator is bound to one language, English by default. Its text is in the language's
script and punctuation, its people are named in the language's name order, and its addresses
and phone numbers are those of the language's default country. `withLanguage` gives a view in
another language that shares the same random generator and clock.

### Languages

`Mihon.languages` lists the languages with data, sorted by tag: `en` (English, United States)
and `la` (Latin, Vatican City). Latin's text is Lorem Ipsum.

A factory or `withLanguage` looks a language up by its tag, then by an alias, then with
subtags stripped from the right, so `en-GB` is served by `en`. A tag that names another script
than the one found is refused (`en-Cyrl`), and so is a language without data, with an
`IllegalArgumentException` that names the tag and the languages there are. With a language
from outside, ask first:

```scala
val mihon = Mihon.secure(Mihon.resolve(requested).getOrElse(Language.English))
mihon.language // the language whose data it uses: en for en-GB
```

### People and addresses

```scala
val p = Mihon.seeded(1L).person
p.givenName; p.familyName; p.gender  // Gender.Female or Gender.Male
p.fullName                           // in the language's name order
p.latin                              // romanised; the same as fullName in Latin script
p.reading                            // the kana reading in Japanese, None elsewhere

val a = Mihon.seeded(1L).address
a.lines                              // top to bottom, in the country's format
a.street; a.city; a.region; a.postalCode; a.country; a.countryCode
```

`email` is built from the romanised name, in ASCII, at a domain under the reserved `.example`
top-level domain, so it never reaches a real host. Digits are ASCII in every language. Where a
country reserves phone numbers for fiction (the United States' 555-0100 to 555-0199), `phone`
uses them; elsewhere a number may be real, so never call or text one.

### Dates

Mihon draws dates as `java.time.LocalDate` values and formats none: format them in the
reader's language with [Taihei Tsuji](https://github.com/taiheiframework/tsuji), whose output
follows each platform's locale data.

### Seeds and the clock

A generator draws every value from its own random number generator and reads today's date from
its own clock. Create one of two kinds:

- `Mihon.secure()` draws from a `java.security.SecureRandom`: the values do not repeat from run
  to run.
- `Mihon.seeded(seed)` draws from a `java.util.Random` with that seed. The same seed, language,
  clock and Mihon version give the same values in the same order, on the JVM and on Scala.js.
  Any other Mihon version, a patch included, may give other values; the release notes say so
  whenever they do. Pin the Mihon version to assert on a seed's values.

Both take the language and a `java.time.Clock`, `Clock.systemUTC()` by default. `today`,
`yesterday`, `tomorrow`, `futureDate` and `pastDate` follow the clock:

```scala
import java.time.{Clock, Instant, ZoneOffset}

val clock = Clock.fixed(Instant.parse("2026-10-24T12:00:00Z"), ZoneOffset.UTC)
val fixed = Mihon.seeded(42L, clock = clock)

fixed.today       // 2026-10-24
fixed.futureDate  // the same date on every run
```

Views from `withLanguage` share one generator, so the order of calls across them is part of what
a seed repeats. One generator may be shared across threads; it stays thread-safe, but the order
in which threads draw then decides the values, so they are no longer reproducible.

### Members by category

- **Text**: `word`, `words`, `sentence`, `sentences`, `paragraph`, `paragraphs`, `htmlParagraphs`, `title`, `slug`
- **People**: `person`, `person(gender)`, `name`, `givenName`, `familyName`, `email`
- **Places and contact**: `address`, `street`, `city`, `postalCode`, `country`, `phone`
- **Dates**: `localDate`, `today`, `yesterday`, `tomorrow`, `futureDate`, `pastDate`
- **Files and the web**: `url`, `fileExtension`, `fileExtensionWithoutDot`, `mimeType`
- **Ids and primitives**: `id`, `character`, `password`, `bool`, `int(bound)` and `long(bound)` (in `[1, bound]`), `double(bound)` (in `[0, bound)`), `times(bound, f)` (one to `bound` items)
- **Languages**: `language`, `withLanguage`, `anyLanguage`; `Mihon.languages`, `Mihon.resolve`
- **Images**: `SampleImages.landscape`, `SampleImages.portrait` (base64 PNGs, constants)

## Testing

```scala
import dev.taihei.mihon.Mihon
import zio.test.*

val mihon = Mihon.seeded(42L)

assertTrue(
  mihon.email.endsWith(".example"),
  mihon.person.fullName.nonEmpty,
)
```

The suite runs on both platforms (`make test`); JS tests execute under Node. `SeededSpec` pins
a seeded run in every language, so it proves on each build that the JVM and Scala.js draw the
same values.

## Data

The language data and where it comes from (Unicode CLDR, the Tatoeba Project, Wikidata, the
U.S. Census Bureau, and formats written for this library) are described in
[docs/data-sources.md](docs/data-sources.md), with the licence of each; NOTICE carries the
attributions. The scripts that build the data are in `scripts/data/`; the build never runs them.
`make validate` checks every data file against its schema and holds the data, the JVM jar and the
Scala.js output to a size budget.

## Coming from taihei-lorem 4.x

Taihei Mihon 5.0.0 is the successor of `dev.taihei::taihei-lorem` 4.x under a new name. The
coordinates and the package change with it:

- the dependency is `dev.taihei::taihei-mihon`;
- the package is `dev.taihei.mihon`, where it was `dev.taihei.lorem`;
- `language` returns a `dev.taihei.tsuji.Language` of
  [Taihei Tsuji](https://github.com/taiheiframework/tsuji) 5, the successor of taihei-i18n.

There is no taihei-lorem 5.0.0 and no relocation from the old coordinates. The two lines are
different artifacts in different packages, so they can be on one classpath side by side.

```sh
# every import of dev.taihei.lorem becomes dev.taihei.mihon
grep -rlZ 'dev\.taihei\.lorem' --include='*.scala' . | xargs -0 perl -pi -e 's/dev\.taihei\.lorem/dev.taihei.mihon/g'
```

The object `LoremIpsum` became the class `Mihon`, bound to one language: create a generator
once and call the members on it. Lorem Ipsum is now the text of Latin.

| 4.x | 5.x |
| --- | --- |
| `LoremIpsum.name` (any generator) | `val mihon = Mihon.secure()`, then `mihon.name` |
| Lorem Ipsum text (`word`, `sentence`, `paragraph` …) | `Mihon.secure(Language("la"))`; an English generator gives English words |
| no way to repeat values | `Mihon.seeded(seed)`; the language is the second parameter, so a clock is `clock = c` |
| `today` is the UTC date by the wall clock | `today` follows the generator's clock, `Clock.systemUTC()` by default |
| `firstName`, `lastName` | `givenName`, `familyName` |
| `zipCode` | `postalCode` |
| `address: String` | `address: Address`; `address.singleLine` is a one-line form |
| `description` | removed: use `sentences` |
| `language` (a random `Language`) | `anyLanguage`, one of `Mihon.languages`; `language` is the generator's own |
| `LoremIpsum.languages` | `Mihon.languages`, the languages with data |
| `city`, `country`, `street`, `phone` from mixed international lists | from the generator's language and its default country; `country` names any country in the language |
| `phone` (`+32` and nine digits) | the calling code and a national number of the default country |
| `dev.taihei.i18n.Language` | `dev.taihei.tsuji.Language` |
| `dev.taihei.lorem.sources.*` (word lists), `SampleWordCollection`, `ResourceLoader` | internal now: use `Mihon` |
| `sources.StateAbbreviations`, `sources.StateFullNames` | removed; nothing used them |
| `id` from `UUID.randomUUID` | a version-4 UUID drawn from the generator, so a seeded one repeats |

The name, city and country lists of 4.x had no recorded source and are gone; the names and
places of 5.x come from the sources in [docs/data-sources.md](docs/data-sources.md).
`SampleImages`, `url`, `id`, `password` and the files and dates generators are unchanged.

## Coming from edo-lorem 3.0.0 or genius-lorem

`com.edoframework::edo-lorem:3.0.0` and `fish.genius::genius-lorem` had the API of
taihei-lorem 4.x in the packages `com.edoframework.lorem` and `genius.lorem`. Replace either
package with `dev.taihei.mihon` in your imports (and `genius.i18n` or `com.edoframework.i18n`
with `dev.taihei.tsuji`), then follow [Coming from taihei-lorem 4.x](#coming-from-taihei-lorem-4x).
genius-lorem 2.0.0 was on an earlier Scala: Taihei Mihon needs Scala 3.9 or later, `zio-json`
1.1, and is under the Apache License 2.0.
