Apply when writing or reviewing Scala that needs test or seed data (text, people, addresses, phone numbers, dates, files, ids, sample images) through dev.taihei.mihon.Mihon, or when migrating from dev.taihei.lorem.LoremIpsum.

# Taihei Mihon (formerly taihei-lorem)

A fake-data generator for Scala 3, cross-compiled for the **JVM and Scala.js**, in many
languages. One class, `Mihon`, bound to one language, with a flat catalog of generators for
text, people, places, dates, files and ids; the values `Person` and `Address`; the enum
`Gender`; and `SampleImages`.

The package is `dev.taihei.mihon`. Artifacts on Maven Central: `dev.taihei::taihei-mihon`,
published as `taihei-mihon_3` (JVM) and `taihei-mihon_sjs1_3` (Scala.js), from 5.0.0, compiled
with Scala 3.9 (LTS), Apache 2.0. It depends on `dev.taihei::taihei-tsuji` 5 for `Language`.
Source: <https://github.com/taiheiframework/mihon>. Up to 4.x it was `dev.taihei::taihei-lorem`
in package `dev.taihei.lorem`, with `LoremIpsum` as an object.

## When to use this skill

Read this whenever you write or review Scala that imports `dev.taihei.mihon.*`, or code on
`dev.taihei.lorem.*` that moves to 5.x: test fixtures, seed data, mock-up content, tests of an
internationalised UI.

## The model

Create a generator with one of two factories; there is no global instance:

```scala
import dev.taihei.mihon.Mihon
import dev.taihei.tsuji.Language

val mihon = Mihon.secure()                    // English; SecureRandom, values do not repeat
val fixed = Mihon.seeded(42L)                 // java.util.Random(42): the same values on every run
val lorem = Mihon.seeded(42L, Language("la")) // Latin: Lorem Ipsum

mihon.name             // in the language's name order
mihon.address.lines    // in the default country's format
mihon.withLanguage(Language("la")).sentence // same generator and clock, other data
```

Both factories take `language` (English by default) and then a `java.time.Clock`
(`Clock.systemUTC()`); `today`, `yesterday`, `tomorrow`, `futureDate` and `pastDate` follow it.

## Reference index

- **`reference/generators.md`**: the full `Mihon` catalog by category, `Person`, `Address`,
  `Gender` and `SampleImages`, with exact signatures.
- **`reference/internals.md`**: languages and their resolution, seeds and reproducibility, the
  clock, the language data and its sources, and the build layout.

## Top gotchas

- The package is **`dev.taihei.mihon`** and the class **`Mihon`**; `LoremIpsum` is gone, with no
  alias. Lorem Ipsum is the text of `Language("la")`; an English generator writes English words.
- `Mihon.seeded(seed, clock)` does not compile: the language is the second parameter, so write
  `Mihon.seeded(seed, clock = c)`.
- A language without data throws `IllegalArgumentException`; with a language from outside, use
  `Mihon.resolve(lang).getOrElse(Language.English)`. `en-GB` is served by `en`; a tag naming
  another script (`en-Cyrl`) is refused.
- A seed repeats **within one Mihon version** only, for the same seed, language and clock; any
  other version, a patch included, may change the values. Pin the version to assert on values;
  otherwise assert on shape.
- `withLanguage` views share one generator: the order of calls across views is part of the
  sequence.
- `firstName`/`lastName` are `givenName`/`familyName`, `zipCode` is `postalCode`, `address`
  returns an `Address`, `description` is removed, and the random `language` is `anyLanguage`.
- Dates are `LocalDate` values; Mihon formats none. Format them with Taihei Tsuji.
- `email` is ASCII in every language (from the romanised name); digits are ASCII everywhere.
- `phone` is fictional only where the country reserves a range (the United States); elsewhere
  a number may be real.
- `password` is fake data, not a credential: from a seeded generator it is predictable.
