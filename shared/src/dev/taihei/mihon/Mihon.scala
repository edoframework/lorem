/**
 * Fake data for tests, seed data and mock-ups, in one language: text, people, addresses, phone
 * numbers, dates, files and ids.
 *
 * A generator is bound to one of [[Mihon.languages]]. Its text is in that language's script and
 * punctuation, its people are named in that language's name order, and its addresses and phone
 * numbers are those of the language's default country. [[withLanguage]] gives a view in another
 * language that shares the same random generator and clock.
 *
 * A generator draws every value from its own random number generator and reads today's date from
 * its own clock; there is no global generator and no wall clock. Create one with [[Mihon.seeded]]
 * for values that repeat from run to run, or with [[Mihon.secure]] for values that do not.
 *
 * One instance may be shared across threads: it stays thread-safe, but which thread gets which
 * value then depends on scheduling, so the values are no longer reproducible.
 *
 * Mihon is for tests and mock-ups. Its data for all its languages adds megabytes to a Scala.js
 * bundle, so it does not belong in a production browser bundle.
